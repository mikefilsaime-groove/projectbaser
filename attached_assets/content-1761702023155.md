## Introduction

Last year [Neumorphism](https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6 "Michał Malewicz article about neumorphism") trend was horrible and awful. In 2020 I expected something even worse, but Michał Malewicz, the creator of **Neumorphism** style, wrote about something fresh and good looking - [Glassmorphism](https://uxdesign.cc/glassmorphism-in-user-interfaces-1f39bb1308c9 "Glassmorphism") style.

let’s take a look at it.

## New trend

Glassmorphism is a new trend which is getting more popular on services like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/search/shots/popular/mobile?q=glass "Dribbble") or [Behance](https://www.behance.net/search/projects?search=glass&tracking_source=typeahead_nav_direct&field=ui%2Fux "Behance").

it’s characteristic features are:

- transparency (frosted-glass)
- vivid or pastel colours
- light border

## Glassmorphism - the CSS way

**Glassmorphism** pretty easy to achieve for frontend developers. There is one main CSS property which we can use - [backdrop-filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter "backdrop-filter"). This property allows you to apply multiple effects such as **blur**, sepia, greyscale to the area behind your component. Since it applies to everything behind the component, to see the effect, you must make this element to be at least partially transparent.

To create **glassmorphism** effect you should use `backdrop-filter: blur()`.

HTML

CSS

```html
<div class="basic">
  <div class="blur"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.basic {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.4);
  position: relative;
}
.blur {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 25px;
  right: 162px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.4);
  backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
}
```

Preview

The image behind has straight `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.4)`. The element above is a copy of the first one but with additional `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` property.

This is the simplest example of a new trend. But we can go even further. You can add recomended by **Michał Malewicz** border-radius, white border and little bit more blur.

> The last thing you can try is to add a 1p inner border with some transparency to your shape. It simulates the glass-edge and can make the shape stand out more from the background.

HTML

CSS

```html
<div class="basic">
  <div class="blur"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.basic {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.4);
  position: relative;
}
.blur {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 25px;
  right: 162px;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.4);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border-radius: 10px;
  border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2);
}
```

## Glassmorphism 2021

I hope that **glassmorphism** will be trendy in 2021. I would like to see real apps built in this style or have a chance to build them on my own.

## Browser compatibility

Property `backdrop-filter` according to [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/css-backdrop-filter "Can I Use") is fully supported by Chrome, Safari, iOS, Android Browser and Edge. Firefox is not supported by default but can be enabled.
